## About

Leverage your conversion rates by integrating the booking form directly in your Joomla pages. Customers will never
have to leave your website for booking an appointment. Take advantage of the scheduling power of Easy!Appointment which
will run smoothly with your Joomla installation.

*Minimum Requirements: Joomla v4+ & PHP v7*

### Connecting Easy!Appointments with Joomla

Install and activate the plugin and navigate to `Modules > Easy!Appointments` menu of the Joomla admin section.
Create a new Easy!Appointments installation or connect to an existing one by providing the preferred URL and destination
path in the page form. Once a connection is established you'll be able to include the booking form in your pages.

### Include Booking in your Pages

Joomla supports the use of custom modules which allow plugins to insert custom content into pages. This extension
takes advantage of this functionality and creates an iframe that displays the booking form of Easy!Appointments.
